Snake game is a simple 2D desktop appplication developed using Java Swing.

The game consists of a snake represented by a set of green dots denoting its body, connected to a single red dot denoing the snake's head.

Whenever the snake's head crosses an apple (denoting food for the snake), the snake grows in size by 1 dot (the snake's size initialized to 5 dots, including the head, at the start of the game).

The game has 3 levels, with the snake's speed being lower in the easy level and higher in the hard level (and intermediate in the medium level).

The game is over when the snake's head collides with its own body or with the borders of the game board.

When the game is over, both the current score and the highest score displayed.
